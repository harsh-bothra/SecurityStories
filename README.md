# SecurityStories - 52 Weeks, 52 Stories

**SecurityStories - 52 Days, 52 Stories** is a new initiative to share stories of cyber security professionals who are spread across the globe to tell the world about how they started, what were the blockers in their journey, where they were vs where they are now and likewise, interesting stuff. This is to inspire the world and share the less-known stories of cyber security professionals.

This will be posted on Twitter & LinkedIn and a Repository will be maintained on GitHub.
